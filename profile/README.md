## Hi [3615.computer](https://www.3615.computer) community! 👋

### Services
- 🌐 Main web page: [www.3615.computer](https://www.3615.computer)
- 🐘 Mastodon instance: [3615.computer](https://www.3615.computer)
- ⛏️ Minecraft servers, see [portal.3615.computer](https://portal.3615.computer)
- 💬 [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+7av7NhuzeBdjNTNk), in case we have to send updates while the instance is down: 

### Information
- 🏳️‍🌈 [Alyx (he/she)](https://github.com/VictorBersy/) is the owner of the organization. See [her profile](https://github.com/VictorBersy#hi-there).
- 📧 3615.computer contact: [contact@3615.computer](mailto:contact@3615.computer)

### Why do we exist?
Alyx just wanted her owner Mastodon instance at first. 

But with such a cool domain, she had to **make a community** 👥.

Registrations will open soon on the Mastodon instance, and members of this instance will get access to exclusive services. Right now, Minecraft servers. Later, maybe more?

### Can I help?

Sure thing! 
- 🤓 Once the registrations will open, I will look for moderators.
- ⤵️ Any pull requests on our projects are also very welcome, even for very small things. Anything helps!
- 📧 Report anything weird, our projects must work as expected. We will investigate any reported issues.
- 🥰 Be kind to yourself and others
