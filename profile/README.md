### Why do we exist?
Alyx just wanted her owner Mastodon's instance at first. 

But with such a cool domain, she had to **make a community** 👥. It's always something I've dreamed of, creating a space, stand back, and see it being filled with lovely people.

Registrations are ~open~ on approval at the moment, because of the recent spam wave. Ask for one you should be accepted without any issues 😊

It has a black AZERTY keyboard, the lays down once detached from the screen. The screen is an old CRT one of course. It's turned on and displays a service to look for people's and companies' numbers/addresses. The back of the terminal is covered with a brownish plastic case."/>

It comes down from the Minitel service deployed in France in the 80s.

>France Télécom estimated that almost 9 million terminals—including web-enabled personal computers (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux)—had access to the network at the end of 1999, and that it was used by 25 million people (of a total population of 60 million). Developed by 10,000 companies, in 1996, almost 26,000 different services were available.

It was an interesting project from the French government. One way to reach out to commercial services was to call "3615" and then type the name of your service on your terminal.
